## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture (Layered: Presentation, Domain, Data)
- **State Management**: Bloc & Cubit
- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth, Database)
- **Dependency Injection**: `get_it`
- **Principles**: SOLID, DRY, Dependency Inversion


## 🔧 Key Implementations
- **SOLID Principles** applied in architecture
- **Bloc-to-Bloc communication** via streams
- **Supabase integration** for backend services
- **Dependency Injection** with `get_it`

# ‚úçÔ∏è Blog App - A Clean Architecture Project

A modern Flutter application designed to showcase a robust implementation of **Clean Architecture**. This project serves as a practical example of building scalable, maintainable, and testable mobile apps using best practices. The app allows users to authenticate, browse a feed of blogs, and create their own posts with images, rich content, and multiple topics.

## üöÄ Features

- **üîí Secure Authentication**: Full user sign-up and sign-in flows powered by Supabase Auth.
- **üåê Global Blog Feed**: A central `BlogPage` where users can view all blogs created by the community.
- **‚úçÔ∏è Create & Upload Blogs**: An `Add New Blog` page that allows users to:
  - Add a captivating title and detailed content.
  - Upload a feature image for each blog post.
  - Select one or more relevant topics from a predefined list.
- **üë§ User Profile**: A dedicated `ProfilePage` for user-specific information.
- **üëÅÔ∏è Persistent User Session**: The app uses a central `AppUserCubit` to manage the global authentication state, automatically navigating users based on whether they are logged in or out.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architectural Decisions

This project was built with a strong emphasis on creating a professional-grade, scalable architecture.

- **Architecture**: **Clean Architecture**
  - **Data Layer**: Manages data from Supabase (network) and is responsible for repository implementations.
  - **Domain Layer**: The core business logic, containing entities and repository contracts. It is completely independent of other layers.
  - **Presentation Layer**: The UI, built with Flutter widgets and managed by Bloc/Cubit.

- **State Management**: **Bloc & Cubit**
  - Enables a clear separation between UI and business logic.
  - **Global Auth State Management**: A singleton `AppUserCubit` is used to manage and provide the current user's authentication state throughout the entire app. This allows different parts of the UI to react instantly to login or logout events.

- **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)**: **Supabase**
  - Handles user authentication (email/password).
  - Provides a Postgres database for storing blog data.
  - Manages storage for uploaded blog images.

- **Dependency Injection**: **`get_it`**
  - Decouples classes and layers by providing dependencies from a central service locator.
  - Makes the app easier to test and maintain.

- **Core Principles**:
  - **SOLID**: The entire architecture is designed around the SOLID principles.
  - **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules; both depend on abstractions.

## üß† What I Learned

Building this project was a fantastic learning experience, particularly in these areas:

- **Architectural Discipline:** The challenge of strictly adhering to Clean Architecture rules, ensuring no dependencies point inwards.
- **State Management at Scale:** Managing complex UI states, handling loading, success, and error cases gracefully with Bloc.
- **Problem-Solving:** Overcame significant native build issues (Gradle configuration) and runtime bugs, strengthening my debugging skills.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Deepened my understanding of `Future`s, `Stream`s, and `async/await` in a real-world application.

This app is a testament to my ability to build robust, well-structured applications and my commitment to writing high-quality code.
